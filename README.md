# Instrument control by Matlab

This repository originally written during my master studies between 2014-2015.  
Matlab GUI based softwares were used to control Keitley DC-DC and SRS Lock-in instrumentation tools.  
Software communicates with the instruments over GPIB protocol.  
MainProgram.fig is the main software unites the other software, but every individual software can be run by .fig file.  
1. Keithley 2400 SMU,  
2. Keithley 2182(a) nanovoltmeter,  
3. Keithley 6200 current source,  
4. Keithley 6485 picoammeter,
5. SRS 830 lockin amplifier,
6. Arduino UNO based custom actuators and controllers.
